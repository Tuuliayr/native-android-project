| Topic  | A mobile application to remind and motivate people who tend to sit still most of the day to move their body. The app gives light exercise suggestions throughout the day. Also, if the weather is nice the app will push a notification that encourages the user to go for a walk outside. For checking weather [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) api is used.|
